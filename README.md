__Node.js sample app for using the [FamilySearch JS Lite SDK](https://github.com/FamilySearch/fs-js-lite).__

The primary purpose of the sample app is to provide working example code for 
using the sdk in Node.js.

A secondary purpose of the sample app is to explore technical issues that need 
to be considered when using the sdk in a node app. Topics covered include:

* Authentication via OAuth 2
* Storing the access token and other data in a session
* Fetching a person's pedigree
* Fetching a person's portrait
* Configuring the SDK with environment variables
* Error handling

The solutions shown by this sample app are not intented to be canonical. There
is almost always more than one way to address a problem.
